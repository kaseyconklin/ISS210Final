  <h1>Synopsis of Kasey Conklin</h1>
  <h4><em>homepage</em></h4>

  <p> My name is Kasey Conklin and I was born on September 9th, 2003, making me 15 years old. I love nature and will find any possible excuse to go outside. I have a small group of really cool friends who have been with me for practically all my life. I try to be their biggest supporter. They have a big part in who I am.
 </p>
<P> I am a current freshman at both the MSC and Lakeview High School. I'm heavily involved with music (both playing and listening), and when I'm not working or school or music, I usually spend my time reading. I'm an aspiring osteopathic pediatrician, and everyday I'm working on getting to that status. My current dream college is the University of Michigan. I am fully aware that it's a highly selective school, so I'm attempting to apply myself as much as I can within the community to make an impact not just in school, but outside of it too.
